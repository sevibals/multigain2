=== Plotting Pareto Curves

For plotting pareto curves generated by MultiGain2.0 we recommend installing Anaconda.footnote:[https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html] Then create a new conda environment.footnote:[For details and trouble shooting see: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands]
[source,shell]
----
conda create -n multigain2 python=3.10
Proceed ([y]/n)? y
----
Activate the environment and install the required packages:
[source,shell]
----
conda activate multigain2
pip install argparse matplotlib
----
Assuming you are still located in the prism directory, you can test the installation by plotting one of our pregenerated files:
[source,shell]
----
python ./etc/scripts/pareto-plot.py examples/results/pareto2d.pareto
